## The Project

OpenTON is an analytical platform that provides up-to-date data on the TON ecosystem with the aim of making it more transparent and accessible to all users. It helps users learn about the state of the TON network and provides deep knowledge of blockchain data.

# Data

We explore the entire TON ecosystem and analyze several main directions:

**On-chain data and blockchain analytics:** This research area covers data stored on the TON blockchain, such as the number of active addresses, transaction volume, validator count, transaction volume, the number of addresses with different balances, and other data that allow us to assess the health and condition of the TON network.

**Financial data:** Within this direction, we analyze data on TON and Jetton trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, price data, trading volumes, open interest, futures and options, asset volatility, correlation with other assets, and other financial metrics that can give us an understanding of market dynamics. In addition to analyzing financial data, we actively collect statistics on the number of token sales, fundraising activity, and funds investing in TON projects. This allows users to get a more complete picture of the TON ecosystem's development and evaluate its prospects for the future.

**Social data:**  This aspect of research includes analyzing the activity of communities, developers, and new users of TON projects. It allows us to assess interest in the TON ecosystem, understand the dynamics of user and application growth, as well as identify potential problems and challenges for the ecosystem.

The data we provide will be visualized in two executions: the main panel and dashboards.

The main panel will allow users to select assets of interest from the TON ecosystem and customize data display parameters according to their interests. For example, users can choose specific time periods to display price data for a particular asset or customize charts to display different metrics.

Dashboards will provide an overview of various data consolidated in one place by topics. For example, a dashboard will display data on prices of various NFTs or statistics on DeFi projects on the TON blockchain. This will allow users to quickly get an overview of their areas of interest without having to search for information in different sources.

## Stages of development
1. MVP - Home Chart Developed 2-3 services, API for charts and main dashboard deployed, MongoDB deployed, united data scraping. Website deployed on Openton.app with 
2. Charts: JetTons - we will add 20 JetTons in our analytical chart, and will need additional work on backend and frontend. Adding analytics to wrapped tokens
3. Charts: Creating a data comparison panel, the ability to save the panel as a jpg, and creating notifications in Telegram
4. Dashboard: Creating Dashboards for network data: nodes, fees, block, mempool, validators, Smart contract
5. Dashboard: Creating Dashboards for network data: addresses, Telegram, community, jetton, NFT, marketplaces, DEX, wallet, maps
6. Dashboard: Creating Dashboards for native TON and Jettons (~20 top): Ownership, Community, Fundraising, Arbitrage data: cex, dex, Dynamic, Liquidity pool
7. Tools: Creating a tool for viewing wallet portfolios by addresses or domain, which will provide detailed information about activity, balance, DeFi, NFT tokens and Jettons
8. Tools: Creating a tool for analyzing NFT collections through smart contract addresses or collection names search: Analysis, Owners, Trades
9. Tools: Creating a tool for analyzing Jettons through smart contract address or names search: Analysis, Owners, Trades, DEX
10. Tools: Creating a tool for visualizing wallet transactions by address
11. Dashboard: Creating a tool for creating a personalized monitoring panel for the user with the ability to add all necessary elements from the main panel
12. Research: Creating a report page and developing 15 automated forms with data for automatic publication in communities. Conducting analysis of block microstructure and modeling network dynamics
13. Academy: Development of a glossary based on the data on the TON blockchain, as well as the preparation of a series of animated videos that explain the features of the TON blockchain and its data
14. Academy: Creating technical tutorials on working with data on the TON blockchain, combining both theoretical and practical aspects, as well as a detailed technical document on working with the API
15. API: Publishing a Block Indexer and a Public API. Providing the capability to integrate our tools into products based on TON
