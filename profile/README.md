## Description

OpenTON is an analytics platform that provides up-to-date data about the TON ecosystem with the aim of making it more transparent and accessible to all users. It helps users learn about the state of the TON network and provides in-depth knowledge about the data on the blockchain.

We explore the entire TON ecosystem and analyze several main directions:

**On-chain data and blockchain analytics:** This research area covers data stored on the TON blockchain, such as the number of active addresses, transaction volume, validator count, transaction volume, the number of addresses with different balances, and other data that allow us to assess the health and condition of the TON network.

**Financial data:** Within this direction, we analyze data on TON and Jetton trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, price data, trading volumes, open interest, futures and options, asset volatility, correlation with other assets, and other financial metrics that can give us an understanding of market dynamics. In addition to analyzing financial data, we actively collect statistics on the number of token sales, fundraising activity, and funds investing in TON projects. This allows users to get a more complete picture of the TON ecosystem's development and evaluate its prospects for the future.

**Social data:**  This aspect of research includes analyzing the activity of communities, developers, and new users of TON projects. It allows us to assess interest in the TON ecosystem, understand the dynamics of user and application growth, as well as identify potential problems and challenges for the ecosystem.
